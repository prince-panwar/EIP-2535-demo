# EIP-2535

This repository contains smart contracts demonstrating the use of the EIP-2535 Diamond Standard. The EIP-2535 Diamond Standard is a powerful design pattern that enables the creation of modular, upgradeable, and scalable smart contracts by allowing multiple facets, each representing distinct functionalities, to exist within a single contract.
